# Gradle Vaadin Plugin
The Gradle plugin allows you to easily build Vaadin projects with Gradle. It helps with the most tedious tasks when 
building a Vaadin project like building the widgetset and running development mode. It also helps you to quickly get 
started by providing tasks for project, component and theme creation.
